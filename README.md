# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three machine learning models aimed at solving classification problems in different domains:

1. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
A project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The focus is on identifying anomalies in transaction data with high accuracy.

2. Customer Churn Prediction:
This model predicts customer churn based on usage behavior and demographic data. It helps businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

3. Spam SMS Detection:
A text classification project that categorizes SMS messages as spam or ham using NLP techniques. Algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines are applied to detect and filter spam effectively.
